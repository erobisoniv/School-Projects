turnin code:  py_p3


Write a python program which will be executed on the ranger systems.
It should read a file named as the first command-line argument.

The file to be read will contain lines which represent sequences of DNA.
Each line of the file will begin in column 1 and contain two items
separated by a single blank.  The first item will be a sequence ID,
and the second item will be the sequence itself.

Examine each sequence to find any candidate genes that may be present in
any of the 3 reading frames.  You may assume that all start codons are
'atg' and that all stop codons are 'tag'.  When you find a candidate gene,
print the ID of the sequence and the displacement into the sequence of
the beginning of the start codon for the gene (relative to 0) and the
length of the gene including all 3 nucleotides of the stop codon.  Do not
accept candidate genes that are less than 20 nucleotides or more than 100.
You may assume that no candidate gene is contained within another.

Inside your program, define a variable named REGEX, and assign it a
regular expression value at least as complex as shown here:
        REGEX = r'atg(.{20,100})tag'
and use your regular expression in detection of candidate genes.

Use turnin to submit a single source file containing your program.
