turnin code:  py_p1


Write a python program which will be executed on the ranger systems.
It should read a file named as the only command-line argument.
It should find the first line in the file where x exceeds 8000.
It should find the first line in the file where y exceeds 9000.
The only lines needing to be examined contain either 'x=' or 'y='.

When you find the desired line(s), print the line (wihtout its newline),
and then on a separate line, print the rank of the printing process,
which is the first value without leading zeros; also print the time of
the print in whole (integer) seconds; then print the value for x or y.

So, for this line:
    000800: 1031: 8000.320347:  x=8888
you would print this:

000800: 1031: 8000.320347:  x=8888
800 8000 x=8888

Use turnin to submit a single source file containing your program.
