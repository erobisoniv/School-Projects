"I feel totally lost."
	"Then Let's see if we can find you in this mess."
	Almost as if on cue, a blue jay landed on the kitchen win-
dowsill and began strutting back and forth.  Papa reached into
a tin on the counter and, sliding the window open, offered
Mr. Jay a mixture of grains that she must have kept just for
that purpose.  Without any hesitation, and with a seeming air
of humility and thankfulness, the bird walked straight to her
hand and began feeding.
	"Consider our little friend here," she began. "Most birds
were created to fly.  Being grounded for them is a limitation
within their ability to fly, not the other way around."  She
paused to let Mack think about her statement.  "You, on the
other hand, were created to be loved.  So for you to live as if
you were unloved is a limitation, not the other way around."
	Mack nodded his head, not so much in full agreement,
but more as a signal that at least he understood and was
tracking.  That seemed simple enough.
	"Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings and remov-
ing its ability to fly.  Not something I want for you."
	There's the rub.  He didn't feel particularly loved at the
moment.
	"Mack, pain has a way of clipping our wings and keeping
us from being able to fly."  She waited a moment, allowing
her words to settle.  "And if left unresolved for very long, you
can almost forget that you were ever created to fly in the first
place."
